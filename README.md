# Susha-Radix

This allows for Radix-Ui Icons to be parsed into Susha Tag Icons for the web. 

---

The provided code shows two functions, getIcon and createIcon, and a class Radix_META which are involved in fetching, loading, and creating icons in a web application.

- getIcon function:

  This asynchronous function aims to fetch an icon from the server. It accepts two parameters: name, which is the name of the icon file (defaults to an empty string if not provided), and dir, which is the directory path (also defaulting to an empty string if not provided). It constructs URLs based on the name and dir to locate the icon file. Then, it performs a web request to get the icon. If the request is successful (status === 200), it returns a Blob object representing the icon; otherwise, it logs an error status and returns false.

- createIcon function:

  This asynchronous function takes a Blob object as an input and converts it into a base64 encoded data URL using a FileReader. It then creates an icon element with various attributes (like role, aria-label, and title) and sets its background image to the base64 encoded SVG content. It returns the newly created icon element.

- Radix_META class:

  This class has a static property struct that is an array of strings representing icon file names. The constructor receives a location parameter with a default value. It initializes an empty object buffers to store Blob references of icons and a loaded property that starts as a promise. The promise waits until all icons in struct are fetched using getIcon and created using createIcon. When all icons are loaded, it resolves the promise and sets loaded to true.

Simple Terms Explanation:

Asynchronous function: A function that operates asynchronously using the event loop, allowing the rest of the code to continue running while it completes its task.
Blob: A file-like object of immutable, raw data; it can represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format.
FileReader: An object that lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer.
base64: A way of encoding binary data as ASCII text, often used for transmitting data in web applications.
URL: A reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.
SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics, an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.
Overall, the code is designed to preload and create icon elements for a web application, ensuring they are ready to use when needed.
